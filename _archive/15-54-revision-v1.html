<p>About 15 birders joined me and National Park Ranger Mark Swartz for a walk along&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113012755/https://www.google.com/maps/place/Olmsted+Park/@42.3251659,-71.1152747,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3799e7cec8f07:0x23a597f711bb181f">Leverett Pond and through Olmsted Park up to Ward&rsquo;s Pond</a>&nbsp;and back.&nbsp; It was cold and damp following the heavy rains overnight but the group was in good spirits, even though the avian harvest was far from abundant.</p>





<p>We began by searching for the Wood Ducks that have been hanging out on the Boston side of one of the small islands in Leverett.&nbsp; The water was so high from the rains it was hard to find the island!&nbsp; But after a search we did manage to discover a few &ldquo;woodies&rdquo; among the sunken shrubbery.&nbsp; Near the end of the walk we were lucky enough to see a beautiful pair close up.&nbsp; The Wood Duck may be the most spectacular native duck in this area:</p>

<p>As we were admiring the Wood Ducks, several Ring-necked Ducks passed by:</p>

<p>Male Ring-necked Ducks. Why isn&rsquo;t this bird named Ring-billed Duck?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>Then someone in the group noticed a pair of Hooded Mergansers hiding in the aquatic undergrowth:</p>

<p>After this hat trick we spent a few minutes comparing female Mallards and American Black Ducks, which can be confusing.</p>





<p>Our search for land birds was disappointing.&nbsp; Other than the usual winter species- robins, titmouses, chickadees, and several sparrow species- we came up short.&nbsp; The youngest member of our group, perhaps ten years old,&nbsp; treated us to his perfect rendition of the call of the Mourning Dove.&nbsp; No real MODO&rsquo;s responded however.&nbsp; As we circled Ward&rsquo;s Pond we did have one Hermit Thrush hidden in a tangled bittersweet vine.&nbsp; This is a lovely bird:</p>

 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113012755/http://www.arbotopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P1040765.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113012755im_/http://www.arbotopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P1040765.jpg" alt="P1040765" class="wp-image-943"/></a> 





<p>Hermit Thrush. The rusty tail and wing primaries distinguish it from other similar thrushes, and it is the only one likely to be seen in this weather.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>The other nice surprise was two Great Blue Herons hunkered down in the reeds around that pond.&nbsp; Seeing them up close demonstrated how big these birds are:</p>

<p>Great Blue Heron. Judging from the plumage of this bird it is likely a juvenile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>Both herons flushed briefly while we were passing by, giving us another view of their impressive size:</p>

<p>Adult Great Blue Heron&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>A few days before the walk Mark and I made a scouting tour of the area and we located a somewhat uncommon bird at Ward&rsquo;s Pond. Of course we were anxious to find it for the group, but it was not to be.&nbsp; Winter Wrens are notorious skulkers, hiding deftly in the underbrush.&nbsp; Other birders had reported the wren in this location off and on for at least a month prior to the walk.&nbsp; Perhaps it had moved on, but more likely it was there, watching us listen and search.&nbsp; Here is an image of the bird taken on our scouting trip:</p>

<p>Winter Wren. This bird is only a little more than three inches in length.&nbsp; At nine grams, you could mail three of them with a single first class stamp!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>This tiny wren carries a big stick when it comes to vocalization however. Here is it&rsquo;s lovely call (sung mostly in the spring):</p>
