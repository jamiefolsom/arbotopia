<p>Saturday April 18th marked the first of a series of spring bird walks in the Arnold Arboretum.&nbsp; We got off with a bang, the weather was fine, and after this dreadful winter the birders came out in droves; over forty people joined the group.&nbsp; After first checking the feeders, where there was only a White-breasted Nuthatch, we moved down Meadow Road and found several Tree Swallows checking out the birdhouses on the grassy slope:</p>

<p>Two male Tree Swallows inspecting a nest box.</p>





<p>This is the earliest swallow species of spring, arriving from Central America and Mexico a little more than a week ago.&nbsp; We now have 15 nest boxes placed around the grounds and many of them will play host to Tree Swallows this spring.</p>





<p>As we continued the walk we began to grow our list of woodpeckers.&nbsp; We ended up with four species, although two were only heard and none gave us great views. The best sighting was two Hairy Woodpeckers chasing each other around in a territorial or mating display.&nbsp; This species is uncommon in the area so it was a nice find.</p>





<p>We headed up the grass slope above the Forsythia Path to the top of Bussey Hill; I was determined to find the first warbler of the year for the group.&nbsp; We entered a group of White Pines where this early arrival likes to hang out; appropriately called the Pine warbler.</p>

<p>Pine Warbler. These warblers are heard more than seen as they spend much of their time high up in conifers. This one was nice enough to come to ground for a photo op.</p>





<p>As we approached the area another recent arrival, a Chipping Sparrow, posed for us and sang its trill; a call so similar to the Pine Warbler that even seasoned birders can confuse them.</p>

<p>Now ready to seek out our target bird, we looked, listened, and even played a Pine Warbler recording- without response.&nbsp; We moved on with regret, but within 100 yards one of our group heard what she thought might be the bird; its trill is shorter, slower, and softer than that of the Chippy.&nbsp; Sure enough, we all heard and then saw our only warbler in this early walk!</p>

<p>As we returned to the main gate we ticked off a number of other resident and early migrant species. Here is our total list for the walk:</p>

<p>The next two Arboretum walks will be back- to- back two weeks from now.&nbsp; On Saturday May 2nd the walk will begin at the Peters Hill Gate at 8 AM. The next morning I&rsquo;ll lead a walk for the Arboretum Park Conservancy in Bussey Brook Meadow beginning at the South Street Gate and also at 8 AM. Both walks are free and birders at all levels are welcome.&nbsp; The migration should be in full swing by then!</p>





<p>Good Birding!</p>
