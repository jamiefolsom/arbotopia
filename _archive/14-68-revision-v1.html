<p>Posted on October 8, 2016</a></p>





<p>This morning twenty people faced 40 degree&nbsp;fall weather for a bird walk in the Arnold Arboretum. &nbsp;Most were local folks but we had a visitor from London and a newly arrived transplant&nbsp;from North Carolina. &nbsp;She was especially pleased when we heard the clarion call of a Carolina Wren:</p>





<p>We were never able to tease it out of the thick underbrush at the edge of the property; too bad as it&nbsp;is a striking little bird:</p>

<p>Carolina Wren, with downturned bill.</p>





<p>Another &ldquo;good&rdquo; bird was only seen by a few people, one of whom was a very competent birder. It was a Red-breasted Nuthatch!</p>

<p>Red-breasted Nuthatch. In contrast to the Carolina Wren, above, this bird has a straight, almost upturned bill.</p>





<p>This is the much less common cousin of the White-breasted Nuthatch, but for some reason &ldquo;RB Nuts&rdquo; &nbsp;are being seen a lot this year.</p>





<p>Our first bird on the walk was a migrant straggler:</p>

<p>Gray Catbird. Most of these common summer migrants have left by late October, heading as far south as Central America.</p>





<p>We saw only one migrating fall warbler and it was too high up and fast moving for a positive identification.</p>





<p>In the lilac collection we came upon several flocks of House Finches, the most numerous&nbsp;bird on the walk.</p>

<p>House Finch, male</p>





<p>We did see one new&nbsp;arrival; a species seldom seen&nbsp;in summer but common in fall and winter:</p>

<p>White-throated Sparrow, Male</p>





<p>When I played it&rsquo;s melancholic song it perked right up!</p>





<p>As we finished the walk we picked up a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk moving about over the wet meadow near the main entrance, thus managing to see at least as many bird species as there were participants in the walk.</p>





<p>Here is the list:</p>
