<p>The weather was&nbsp;quite different for the two spring bird walks I led this weekend; Saturday was sunny and quite warm but Sunday was cool and cloudy with occasional rain.&nbsp; The attendance was reflected by the weather; 46 on Saturday and 17 on Sunday.&nbsp; The locale for the first was the Arnold Arboretum, designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted, and the second was another Olmsted creation farther down the Emerald Necklace at&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/8ocH2s">Leverett Pond</a>&nbsp;and Olmsted Park.</p>





<p>In the Arboretum we ticked off some resident birds as our large group moved down Meadow Road; Song Sparrow, Red-belied Woodpecker, Common Grackle and American Goldfinch.&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;some images&nbsp;of them:</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align:center">The Common Grackle in some light is solid black, but can show a beautiful iridescence on the head setting off its white eyes.</p>

<p>American Goldfinches are rather drab in winter but the spring plumage is striking, often looking like warbler at first glance.</p>





<p>My co-leader Brendan pointed out a Tree Swallow peaking out of a nest box that he had erected just a few weeks earlier:</p>

<p>We proceeded to the ponds where there wasn&rsquo;t much action bird wise, but we did enjoy a few turtles</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1634} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1010865.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1634"/> 





<p>This Eastern Painted Turtle emerged from the mud beneath Faxon Pond just a few weeks ago.</p>





<p>The three&nbsp;ponds created by Olmsted are the only major water feature in the park and can attract some unusual fauna; this mink was spotted there about a month ago</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1635} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1010692.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1635"/> 





<p>American Mink. This member of the weasel family is uncommon away from rivers or other large bodies of water.</p>





<p>We ascended to the top of Bussey Hill where we spent some time trying to tease out the calls of two recent spring arrivals; Chipping Sparrow:Audio Player00:0000:0000:00<a href="javascript:void(0);">Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.</a></p>





<p>and&nbsp;and Pine Warbler:Audio Player00:0000:0000:00<a href="javascript:void(0);">Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.</a></p>

<p>We knew chippers were present&nbsp;because we saw them:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1290} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2016/05/P1120526.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1290"/> 





<p>Chipping Sparrow, a small sparrow with a plain whitish breast and a crisp rusty cap and eyeline is an early spring arrival.</p>





<p>I played a recording of the Pine Warbler and there was some response but at first I couldn&rsquo;t be sure which species was responding.&nbsp; A few minutes later as we moved along I did hear the shorter,&nbsp;softer&nbsp;trill of the warbler although we never saw it; too bad as it&rsquo;s good looking:</p>

<p>Male Pine Warbler</p>





<p>As we began our return route I spied a Hermit Thrush which briefly teed up on a small tree allowing&nbsp;folks near me to see it.&nbsp; For those who missed it here is an image of this lovely early spring thrush as it passes through the area heading for breeding territory farther north:</p>

<p>Hermit Thrush showing a white eye ring, brown back and rust colored tail which it often bobs up and down.</p>





<p>We stopped at an area on the Bussey Hill slope where trillum bloom every spring; I thought it was too early but&nbsp;some were just opening from the bud stage:</p>

<p>As we ended the Arboretum walk a keen eyed member spotted a robin on a nest;&nbsp; breeding season has begun!</p>

<p>When I first looked at my favorite weather app on Sunday at 6:30 AM rain was predicted for 9:45.&nbsp; Perfect; the walk would just be ending!&nbsp; But by the time I got to our starting point in&nbsp;Brookline the update&nbsp;showed rain starting at 8 AM, just when we began.&nbsp; It was right, but fortunately the rain never became too heavy so those that showed up went home a bit cold but not too wet.&nbsp; The target bird for the Leverett Pond walk was the first one we saw:</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align:center">Two female and a male Wood Duck.</p>





<p>The interesting history of these colorful ducks in the Emerald Necklace was discussed in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arbotopia.com/a-leverett-pondolmsted-park-walk/">previous blog</a>.&nbsp; Chances that these ducks will once again breed on this or another close by pond are excellent!&nbsp; We headed up along the Boston side of this pond that straddles&nbsp;the Boston/Brookline boundary and heard a Red-bellied Woodpecker:Audio Player00:0000:0000:00<a href="javascript:void(0);">Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.</a></p>

<p>This call is so distinctive that you don&rsquo;t have to see the bird for a positive identification; nothing else sounds like it.&nbsp; We also picked up another woodpecker species nearby:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1643} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1010496.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1643"/> 





<p>Male Downy Woodpecker. This is the smallest and commonest woodpecker in this area.</p>





<p>When the rain lessened we decided to go all the way up through Olmsted Park to Ward&rsquo;s Pond.&nbsp; The pond was empty of waterfowl, as it often is, but there was some activity in the nearby trees.&nbsp; Only a few saw the Eastern Phoebe before it flew off:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1644} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1000731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1644"/> 





<p>Eastern Phoebe is a spring species that bobs or pumps it&rsquo;s tail, as do Palm Warbler and Hermit Thrush. It is a good field sign for quick identification.</p>





<p>We also heard and saw several Tufted Titmouses; yes that&rsquo;s the official ornithological plural:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1645} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1090358.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1645"/> 





<p>The Tufted Titmouse, a year around bird in Boston, always reminds me of a miniature cardinal captured on black-and-white film.</p>





<p>The rain began in earnest again so we headed back to our cars.&nbsp; On the way we had a nice look at an adult Double-crested Cormorant on the pond:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1646} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1010986.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1646"/> 





<p>Adult Double-crested Cormorant. Related to pelicans, these birds have a reptilian appearance.</p>





<p>I was about to declare that we would have to end the walk without seeing a migrant warbler when someone noticed some small birds moving about high in the trees against the gray sky. Yellow-rumped Warblers!</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1647} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/04/P1120856.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1647"/> 





<p>Male Yellow-rumped Warbler. You have to look closely in this image to see the yellow patch above the tail, which defines it&rsquo;s name and also it&rsquo;s nickname- Butterbutt</p>





<p>This is far and away the commonest warbler seen early in the spring migration.&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not breed in Boston; most&nbsp;are passing through to northern New England and Canada but some breed in western Massachusetts.</p>





<p>Here is our list for Sundays walk:</p>





<p><strong>Olmsted Park&ndash;Leverett Pond</strong>, Suffolk/Norfolk Counties,&nbsp;Massachusetts<br>Apr 29, 2018 8:00 AM &ndash; 9:30 AM<br>Comments: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BBC walk 48-50. clouds and rain,&nbsp; 17 participants<br>19 species</p>
