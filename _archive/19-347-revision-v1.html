<p>The female Baltimore Oriole that appeared at my feeders on the day of the big storm of February 8th continues to the present and has survived another storm. I have seen her every day since she first appeared.&nbsp; She usually visits the feeder at least a dozen times during the day, mostly eating hulled sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>A few days ago I recalled that the traditional attraction for orioles at the feeder is oranges so I put one out.&nbsp; At first she ignored it, continuing to feast on seeds for the next several visits.&nbsp; Eventually though she went to the orange half and by dusk she had cleaned it out:</p>

<p>Fortunately we have some HoneyBell oranges left over from a holiday gift and going downhill.&nbsp; Nothing like a sugar high at the end of the day to build up some calories for the long, cold winter night.</p>
