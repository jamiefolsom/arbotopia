This weekend I led walks- at the Arnold Arboretum and nearby Leverett Pond and Olmsted Park- on the Emerald Necklace to try to find some early birds in the spring migration.  In many ways the walks were similar; we missed the recurrent rains of this wet spring, but the weather was less than perfect for both walks.  Despite that, about 20 birders joined each walk and we ended up seeing about the sane number of species on each.

On Saturday April 27th, accompanied by 19 birders and my co-leader Brendan Keegan, we walked from the main entrance of the Arboretum to the top of Bussey Hill and back through the Shrub & Vine Garden to our start. There had been heavy rain overnight and the temperature was 40 with brisk winds- not an auspicious beginning.  As we headed down the road we heard one of our two woodpecker species on the walk:![](/images/P1030156-3.jpg "Red-bellied Woodpecker")

Red-bellied Woodpecker

We heard an early arriving sparrow in several locations but never got a good look at one. Here's what we missed:

This Chipping Sparrow's song is a rapid series of chip notes

As we approached a wet spot to the right of the road I told the group that an exciting duck had been spotted there earlier in the week; could it still be there?

Not only was one present, there were two pair!  Everyone had good looks at these beauties.

I predicted that this might be out best bird of the walk, and unfortunately I was right.  We ascended the path to the top of Bussey Hill where the wind was howling, and although I had seen three species of early spring warblers there earlier in the week there were none today.  Here's a shot of one that I had seen two days earlier, in better weather:

The Pine Warbler has a song very similar to the Chipping Sparrow

We ticked off  a few more species but were disappointed with the lack of warblers.  Here is our list for the walk:

THE SECOND WALK

On Sunday I moved farther down the Emerald Necklace to lead a walk at Leverett Pond/Olmsted Park for the [Brookline GreenSpace Alliance](http://www.brooklinegreenspace.org).  Two dozen folks showed up ready for a nice walk and hopefully some good birds.  Although the weather was somewhat better than it had been for yesterday's walk, birds were not easy to come by.  The "target bird" for Leverett is Wood Duck.  I had scouted for the walk twice in the pervious week and had not seen one!  But one of my reliable birders reported that he had seen one on his way to the walk.  Sure enough we followed him to tiny Willow Pond and found not one but a pair:

This shot of a pair of Wood Ducks shows why they are so sought after. The male is spectacular, but the more subtle female is equally lovely.

As we looked across Leverett Pond there were a number of swallows flying back and forth just above the water hunting insects.  Most were Tree Swallows but a keen eyed birder spotted one with a orange breast- a Barn Swallow!
