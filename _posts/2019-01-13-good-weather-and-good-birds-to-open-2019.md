There was a huge turnout for the first Arboretum bird walk in the new year; more than fifty people showed up hoping start their year list with some regular winter species as well as some rarities.  We were not disappointed.   The walk started at the feeding station near the Administration Building but there were few birds on the feeders. One nice one made a brief appearance and was seen by some.

As we moved along Meadow Road the birding picked up. Beneath some shrubs we located a group of sparrows, and among them was an uncommon one:

_Immature White-crowned Sparrow. The plain breast, brown and cream head stripes, and orange bill are distinctive_

There were several White-Throated Sparrows and a Song Sparrow in the mix, providing a great  chance to compare and contrast:

We saw or heard three species of woodpecker, including this uncommon one:

After we got to almost fully iced-over ponds we returned, ticking off some other resident and winter birds, including a Northern Mockingbird:

A couple of us got a quick look at this tiny beauty, a Golden-crowned Kinglet:

_This Golden-crowned Kinglet has indeed a golden-yellow central head stripe._

This is the "winter kinglet"; the other in this group is seen more often in warmer weather:

_Ruby-crowned Kinglet. These  birds don't always show their red top-knot as this agitated one is. They also have a thin white eye-ring._

They are fast-moving gems; hard to see and photograph.

My partner Brendan Keegan will be leading monthly walks in the Arnold Arboretum throughout the winter and early spring; his next walk will be on Saturday February 23rd.  I hope you can join him at the main gate at 9 AM.  I will start up my spring walks on Saturday April 27th, beginning at the same gate but at 8AM.

Good Birding!
