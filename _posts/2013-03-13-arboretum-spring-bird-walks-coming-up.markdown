As we turn our clocks forward inviting in the spring it’s a good time to plan ahead for a bird walk or more in the Arnold Arboretum.  Here is this year’s schedule, presented with some images of birds likely to be seen and/or heard on each walk as the spring migration proceeds:

Saturday April 20— Meadow Road to Bussey Hill:  A 90-minute walk suitable for beginners as well as more experienced birders. Meeting place: Inside the main gate off the Arborway (parking along the Arborway) .  8:00 a.m.

For all of these walks the start time is 8:00AM, but note that the last walk is on Sunday not Saturday.  See the arboretum website [http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu](http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/) for directions or to [download a checklist of birds](http://arboretum.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/BirdList-rev5-09.pdf).  Andrew Joslin will co-lead many of these walks. They are all listed by the BBC in their spring Blue Book as well. Arboretum members may sign up for the walks on the AA website [calendar](https://my.arboretum.harvard.edu/CalendarView.aspx). A limited number of loaner binoculars will be available.  The walks will take place rain or shine unless the weather is truly miserable. For questions about cancellations or anything else contact:

Spring bird walks are being held at other local sites as well.  Get up, get out, enjoy the migration!

Good Birding
