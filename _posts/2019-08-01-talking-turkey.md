As we prepare to enjoy the Thanksgiving celebration it seems a good time to appreciate the Wild Turkey. This beautiful creature was once proposed as our national bird by Ben Franklin (glad that didn’t happen- eating the national bird wouldn’t have gone over so well).

The combination of being fairly easy to hunt (try telling that to a turkey hunter! ) and good to eat extinguished the Wild Turkey from Massachusetts in the 1850′s; they were reintroduced in 1970. Today they are quite common throughout the state, even in urban areas:

The most reliable place to see Wild Turkeys in our area is the [Boston Nature Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20141218232850/http://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/boston-nature-center). They are big, aggressive birds. I have been chased by them more than once while walking there:

While turkeys are seen mostly on the ground in fields or open woodland, they often roost in trees at night to hide from predators such as coyotes:

Seen in full sunlight, these birds dazzle:

But when it comes to Turkey Day, I’ll go for a domestic bird over one of the tough guys pictured above:
