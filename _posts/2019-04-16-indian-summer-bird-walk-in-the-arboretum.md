On Saturday I led a group of 13 birders on a walk in the Meadow Road area of the Arboretum. The walk started off at 8 AM with temperatures in the low 50’s but by 10AM the thermometer was reading 72 and headed upwards. The fall migration has been very slow in Boston and today was no exception; we had no northern birds passing through. Overall the species diversity was low, but we did have good looks at several resident birds.

Two of the three man-made ponds at the end of Meadow Road are nearly dry, but there was a Great Blue Heron feasting on the concentration of fish in the dwindling pool.

Elsewhere we had good looks at several of the resident Red-tailed Hawks in the Arboretum.

I will conduct another Arnold Arboretum fall walk this Saturday, October 4th at 8AM, starting from the Peters Hill Gate. Hopefully the later date, and the abundance of fall fruit on the hill, will bring in some migrants! Hope to see you there.

Good Birding!
