<p>Posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604143124/http://www.arbotopia.com/birding-the-hood/">May 23, 2016</a></p>





<p>On Sunday morning 28 neighbors met at my home on Sumner Hill in Jamaica Plain for some casual urban birding. &nbsp;I have a little game I play with myself; trying to find more bird species than there are birders on my&nbsp;walks. &nbsp;The last time I did a walk for the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604143124/https://www.facebook.com/Sumner-Hill-Association-112329112138989/">Sumner Hill Association</a>&nbsp;there were over fifty people and we got only 14 species. &nbsp;This year we beat the record, but again didn&rsquo;t come close on my game.</p>





<p>Starting in our side yard, we listened for bird song, and saw a few birds as well. &nbsp;Everyone got a good look at a Gray Catbird, true to it&rsquo;s name it is all gray except for a rusty patch&nbsp;under the tail:</p>

<p>As the group moved on I noticed that we had several very&nbsp;young people among us; and some of them were into birds. &nbsp;A next door neighbor arrived with her twin daughters who had just graduated from college in western Massachusetts. They had not spent all their time&nbsp;on the textbooks; they knew their birds. &nbsp;Even more impressive, several youngsters still in grade school were using their binoculars with dexterity. &nbsp;And one ten year old clearly had some grownup birding chops. &nbsp;Turns out his Grandma is the editor of a&nbsp;distinguished birding journal, &nbsp;and he told me he started birding when he was three!</p>





<p>We continued down to the Southwest Corridor, which runs along the Green Line and Commuter Rail tracks and forms the southern &nbsp;boundary of our neighborhood. &nbsp;A birding friend had told me that she was seeing Baltimore Orioles in the area, so I had some hopes of finding one. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;But we did pick up a Chipping Sparrow along the way:</p>

<p>Chipping Sparrow. This seasonal sparrow arrives in April, breeds in the area, and is gone south by&nbsp;November.</p>





<p>We listened to it&rsquo;s trill, but it wouldn&rsquo;t reveal itself. &nbsp;We got the non-native urban birds, plus&nbsp;some other year round birds.&nbsp;Our ten year old prodigy thought he heard a Red-bellied Woodpecker. &nbsp;Too eager perhaps? &nbsp;No, in fact when we put out an iPhone call it responded for many to hear. &nbsp;Here is it&rsquo;s call:</p>

<p>And here is an image of this lovely, once southern, woodpecker; now commonplace in Boston:</p>

<p>Red-bellied Woodpecker, male. &nbsp;Twenty&nbsp;years ago a sighting of this species would have drawn birders from all over New England; now it nests regularly on the Emerald Necklace.</p>





<p>After admiring a few more Northern Cardinals, the new college graduates saw a White-breasted Nuthatch in a big oak on the street. &nbsp;Regrettably,&nbsp;it flew before others&nbsp;could see it; here is what it would have been:</p>

<p>The White-breasted Nuthatch is the commonest nuthatch in this area. Look for it moving along a tree trunk, seeking out tiny insects to eat.</p>





<p>Here is our meager list for the walk:</p>

<p>Hey, Sumner Hill isn&rsquo;t Mount Auburn Cemetery. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s still a great place for a Sunday bird walk!</p>





<p>Good Birding!<br></p>
