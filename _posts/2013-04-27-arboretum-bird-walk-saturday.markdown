<p>The first walk of the spring season was a wash out, but the weather was glorious this morning and brought out nearly 40 people of varying experience levels for a nice walk in sections of Peters Hill and Hemlock Hill.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t turn up any rarities but did see and hear lots of the birds expected this early in the spring migration.&nbsp; Highlights were Pine Warblers along side of Chipping Sparrows, providing a great comparison of these two sing-a- likes.&nbsp; Pine Warbler, whose call is shorter, more melodic and &ldquo;rounder&rdquo; than the Chipping Sparrow, is the first migrant warbler to arrive in Boston, usually in early April.</p>

<p>A sharp-eyed member of the group spotted a Red-breasted Nuthatch on a tree trunk at the top of Hemlock Hill allowing for close up looks at this uncommon little bird.</p>

<p>Another bird of note was a Brown Thrasher.&nbsp; These migrant members of the Mimidae family arrived in the Arboretum just this week from more southern states.&nbsp; The bird we saw was perched high in a maple tree and while it was easily heard repeating it&rsquo;s two or three phrase call it was difficult to see well.&nbsp; Up close it is a striking bird:</p>

<p>Thrashers share their family with the more common Northern Mockingbird, a year round resident and famous mimic, and the Gray Catbird, which will not arrive in Boston for another week or so.</p>


<p>We ended up the walk with the discovery of many owl pellets on Hemlock Hill, but couldn&rsquo;t find the owl. Instead the group was regaled with stories of the one-eyed Great Horned Owl mother and her two owlets that fledged recently at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arbotopia.com/new-great-horned-owl-nesting/">Forest Hills Cemetery</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; One person said she felt like she was back at scout camp!&nbsp; A good time was had by all.&nbsp; The full list of birds:</p>
