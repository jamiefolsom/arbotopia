<p>People drawn to birding are a pretty good group, which makes leading walks very pleasant most of the time even if the birds are scarce.&nbsp; Those that get serious about it often show some common characteristics;&nbsp; they are quite obsessive and sometimes competitive.&nbsp; Thus the beginning of the new year brings out the urge to start again a new Year List, and try to beat last year&rsquo;s total (and everyone else&rsquo;s).&nbsp; Suddenly robins, jays and chickadees are appreciated and ticked off for the list.</p>





<p>This morning a dozen birders, some quite new to the business, were delighted to find a perfect winter day for our walk.&nbsp; We did not see any spectacular birds, but did get good looks at some common ones. Most in the group added one or two new birds to their 2014 list.&nbsp; We had great looks at several Red-tailed Hawks&mdash; perched and in flight.</p>

<p>More often than not the hawk shows you it&rsquo;s front and displays a creamy-white breast and frequently a speckled &ldquo;belly band&rdquo;:</p>

<p>This immature Red-Tailed Hawk was photographed recently stalking my bird feeders. They prefer a mammalian diet but are not above a bird snack in the harsh winter months.<br>Photo: Bob Mayer</p>





<p>We saw a number of Houses Finches; at the Arboretum feeder as well as in trees.&nbsp; The males are a particularly lovely sight against the drab winter landscape:</p>

<p>As the walk began to wind down I commented on the absence of any woodpecker species, some of which are fairly common in the Arboretum.&nbsp; Within minutes a keen-eyed birder called out &ldquo;woodpecker&rdquo;, and we all got good looks at one of these:</p>
