The last of a series of spring bird walks in the Arnold Arboretum attracted over thirty participants in very nice early summer weather. We also saw some birds although we had no migrant species.

Early on, our youngest birder spotted something at the top of a conifer; I was ready to pass it off as a common Chipping Sparrow but she commented that it seemed too big. She was right; it was an Eastern Kingbird. This large member of the flycatcher family gave everyone good looks.

Our other flycatcher was not as cooperative. High up in some fully leafed out trees, we first heard the “wheep” call of a Great-crested Flycatcher. After some searching, most of us got some fleeting looks as it moved about the canopy at the top of Peters Hill.

Our only other bird of note was a nice male Orchard Oriole. Baltimore Orioles are quite common in the Arboretum during the spring and summer. Orchards also nest here, but they are seen much less frequently.

Male Orchard Oriole. This species is identical to it’s more common cousin, the Baltimore Oriole, except for the darker, rusty breast and back rather than the orange color of the Baltimore.

Over the summer I intend to report signs of avian nesting in the Arboretum, and pick up on other fauna that can be seen during the birding doldrums of June and July. Stay tuned!
