<p>In my last post I indicated I would be leading a walk at the Arboretum this Saturday April 26th.  A family conflict arose however, so I won’t be able to lead the walk.  My friend and frequent co-leader of bird walks, Andrew Joslin, has agreed to stand in for me so the walk will proceed as planned, weather permitting.</p>

<p>Most people are aware that late April and early May is the time when migrating warblers and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine">passerine</a> birds arrive in Massachusetts.  What many don’t realize however is that some of these warblers pass through in a matter of a few weeks, so this is the only time to see them in the spring.  Some will re-appear briefly in the fall – on their return trip to Central and South America – but by then their bright breeding coloration is gone.  Palm Warbler is a good example.</p>

<p>These pretty little birds are known for their habit of “tail-pumping”  which helps to identify them in the field.  Palm Warblers will be gone by  mid-May, moving on to breeding grounds farther north, so this is the time to see them.  There will be other nice birds on Saturday as well:</p>

<p>So please join Andrew if you can. And don’t forget my next walk which will be on Saturday May 3  starting from the Peter’s Hill Gate off Bussey Street at 8AM.</p>
