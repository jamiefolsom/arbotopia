<p>In my last post I indicated I would be leading a walk at the Arboretum this Saturday April 26th.&nbsp; A family conflict arose however, so I won&rsquo;t be able to lead the walk.&nbsp; My friend and frequent co-leader of bird walks, Andrew Joslin, has agreed to stand in for me so the walk will proceed as planned, weather permitting.</p>

<p>Most people are aware that late April and early May is the time when migrating warblers and other&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140426104415/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine">passerine</a>&nbsp;birds arrive in Massachusetts.&nbsp; What many don&rsquo;t realize however is that some of these warblers pass through in a matter of a few weeks, so this is the only time to see them in the spring.&nbsp; Some will re-appear briefly in the fall &ndash; on their return trip to Central and South America &ndash; but by then their bright breeding coloration is gone.&nbsp; Palm Warbler is a good example.</p>

<p>These pretty little birds are known for their habit of &ldquo;tail-pumping&rdquo;&nbsp; which helps to identify them in the field.&nbsp; Palm Warblers will be gone by&nbsp; mid-May, moving on to breeding grounds farther north, so this is the time to see them.&nbsp; There will be other nice birds on Saturday as well:</p>

<p>So please join Andrew if you can. And don&rsquo;t forget my next walk which will be on Saturday May 3&nbsp; starting from the Peter&rsquo;s Hill Gate off Bussey Street at 8AM.</p>
