<p>Posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192551/http://www.arbotopia.com/a-bright-and-windy-walk-in-bussey-brook-meadow/">May 7, 2017</a></p>





<p>There was a major shift in the weather compared to yesterdays walk on Hemlock Hill and Peter&rsquo;s Hill, and the turnout reflected that. Nearly 50 folks showed up for this walk, sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brooklinebirdclub.org/">Brookline Bird Club</a>, the Arnold Arboretum and the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192551/http://www.arboretumparkconservancy.org/">Arboretum Park Conservancy</a>(APC). &nbsp;The APC developed and helps to maintain this 28 acre section of the Arboretum where AA researchers study the impact of the urban environment on native and non-native invasive&nbsp;plants. It also provides a pleasant link to the Arboretum from&nbsp;the Orange Line Forest Hills MBTA. &nbsp;We first walked in the grass along&nbsp;South Street where a coalition of groups is working to build a walk and bike pathway that&nbsp;will connect the Roslindale commuter rail station to the Southwest Corridor at Forest Hills.</p>





<p>There was a lot of familiar bird call as we began the walk; Song Sparrows, jays, cardinals, robins and Baltimore Orioles. &nbsp;But the birds were hard to locate at first. &nbsp;When we returned to the main Blackwell Path we spotted the first of only two warbler species we had on the walk; Yellow-rumped Warbler.</p>

<p>You can barely see the yellow patch above the tail on this male bird, giving it the nickname &ldquo;butterbutt&rdquo;.</p>





<p>Farther down the path we kept hearing the song of a Yellow Warbler but couldn&rsquo;t locate it; some hear&nbsp;it saying &ldquo;sweet, sweet, little more sweet&rdquo;. &nbsp;Finally a sharp-eyed birder located the bird:</p>

<p>Also heard in the same location was another early migrant, Warbling Vireo:</p>

<p>While we were listening to this melodious song someone noticed a nest high in a tree that appeared to have a bird in it. &nbsp;My first guess was that we were looking at a partially built oriole nest, but when the bird flew out others saw no yellow on the&nbsp;exiting bird,&nbsp;putting my call in question. &nbsp;Indeed, the bird, and the nest, was that of the singing vireo!</p>

<p>Warbling Vireo on nest.</p>





<p>I stood corrected! &nbsp;We saw another nesting species on the walk:</p>

<p>American Robin on nest. Robins build heavy nests often low down in the landscape.</p>





<p>We were never able to locate a Baltimore Oriole at nest (too early I think), but we had lots of great views of this lovely spring migrant. &nbsp;At one point several orioles were chasing each other about and seemed oblivious to our large group as they buzzed by at eye level! &nbsp;This was the high point of the walk for many.</p>

<p>An oriole captured taking out the trash. If you look closely he has a &ldquo;fecal sac&rdquo; in his bill; removing fledgling waste from the nest behind, to deter odors that might give the nest away to predators.</p>





<p>I had done some scouting for the walk earlier in&nbsp;the week and on two occasions I saw an unusual bird for urban Boston, Solitary Sandpiper:</p>

<p>This was the Solitary Sandpiper I saw two days before the walk in BBM.</p>





<p>But the bird had apparently moved on. They only migrate through our area, heading for nesting territory in Canada and Alaska.</p>





<p>As we returned to the parking area we again saw and heard a number of the birds we teased out earlier. &nbsp;Overall the walk produced limited species diversity, but a lot of fun. Here is the total list:</p>

<p>I will not be leading walks next weekend as that Sunday is the Lilac Sunday festival and I will be doing botanical tours then. &nbsp;And on Saturday May 13th I will spend the day birding with some friends in the southeastern part of the state for Mass Audubon&rsquo;s Bird-a-thon. We will try to identify 70 or more species, weather permitting, in support of Boston&rsquo;s urban sanctuary, the Boston Nature Center in Mattapan. &nbsp;If you are interested in supporting the programs at the BNC you can go to my&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192551/https://goo.gl/vBoKGt">fundraising page</a></p>





<p>Thanks!</p>





<p>My last spring walk in the AA will be on Saturday May 20th beginning at the main gate off the Arborway at 8:00AM</p>





<p>Good Birding!<br></p>
