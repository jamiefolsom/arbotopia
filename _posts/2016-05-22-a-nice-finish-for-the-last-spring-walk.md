Two dozen birders joined me on a beautiful morning for a walk from the main gate to Bussey Hill and back at the Arnold Arboretum.  As the passerine migration begins to subside we were hoping for some warbler action, but it was not to be.  A number of nesting Yellow Warblers were seen and heard throughout the walk, but the only other warbler was an American Redstart at the top of the hill.

One member of the group heard a Common Yellowthroat, another warbler that nests in the Arboretum, but as no one else heard it, we kept with the “two observers must see or hear for it to count” birding rule.  Warbling Vireos, a bird better heard than seen, were heard frequently, and seen less so:

Even more common than the vireos were Baltimore Orioles, and we saw several of their hanging nests:

Speaking of nests, we saw a number of robin nests; then we watched this bird fly to it’s nest hole, pause briefly and call, then disappear into the hole!

As we walked up the grassy southern slope to the top of Bussey Hill, we spotted two flycatchers in the same tree; Eastern Phoebe and Eastern Kingbird.  I posted images of these birds on my blog [last week](https://web.archive.org/web/20160725160650/http://www.arbotopia.com/an-urban-wild-in-the-arnold-arboretum/).  At another location, two members of the group heard the distinct call of a different flycatcher, the Eastern Wood-pewee.  These birds stay in the deep woods where they are usually identified by their song:

In a nearby tree we found a flock of Cedar Waxwings, dressed for a formal occasion:

I had taken the group to the Explorer’s Garden near the top of the hill because I had had some good migrating birds there two days before.  Today the only warbler was the Redstart mentioned earlier.  I listened for the song of the Scarlet Tanager, but heard nothing.  Then as we prepared to descend the hill I heard it. Then we saw it!

This bird was a “lifer” for many in the group.  Beyond that it was all downhill ornithologically as well as topographically .  Except for the Wood Thrushes calling in the North Woods:
