<p>In my <a href="http://www.arbotopia.com/butterfly-postscript-and-fall-bird-walks/">last post</a> on  the Pipevine Swallowtail caterpillars I also included three images of a female Ruby-throated Hummingbird that I photographed on the same Harlequin Glorybower bush that harbored the Pipevine butterfly.  A keen 11 year old observer from Maine contacted me, kindness of her grandmother, to point out something in the images I had completely missed.  On the left side of the pictures the head, thorax and powerful front leg of a Praying Mantis are clearly visible:</p>

<p>The Praying Mantis and the Ruby-throated Hummingbird appear to be staring each other down.</p>

<p>This young naturalist took it one more step; she expressed worry that the hummer might fall prey to the preying Praying Mantis, and asked Grandma to query me on that issue.  As I read the email I mused that a child would be so naive as to think that a feisty hummingbird could possibly fall victim to a fierce, but much smaller, insect.  Then I read on; for backup she pointed me to a recent article in the New York Times.</p>

<p> I heartily recommend that all readers of this blog read this Science Times piece, Birds Beware: The Praying Mantis Wants Your Brain By <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/by/natalie-angier">Natalie Angier, </a>Sept. 22, 2017, not only for the raft of fascinating information about these critters, and the complete confirmation of my friend's fears, but also to view spectacular photos of exotic mantid species worldwide.<br></p>

<p>Speaking of mantid pictures, this is the second time in a week that I have stumbled on, or been led to, a Praying Mantis in a photo I took when I hadn't noticed it in the field:</p>

<img src="/images/2017/09/Painted-Lady-and-Praying-Mantis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1513"/>

<p>With this photo I was documenting a Painted Lady <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004090633/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_cardui">Vanessa cardui</a></em> butterfly, one of hundreds migrating through Boston right now, on a Butterfly Bush at the Boston Nature Center. Only when I got home and uploaded the image on my computer did I notice the Praying Mantis <em>Mantis religiosa</em> above.  Camouflage or inattention?</p>

<p>As to your concern, Grace, I can't say for sure that the hummingbird survived to fly south sometime last week, but I do know it flew away from the predator while I was present.  And as the NYT article reports, predation of birds by Praying Mantises is pretty rare; they are prowling around in flowering bushes looking primarily for more reasonably sized fare- bees, wasps and probably butterflies!</p>

<p>Thank you for drawing all of this to my attention.<br></p>
