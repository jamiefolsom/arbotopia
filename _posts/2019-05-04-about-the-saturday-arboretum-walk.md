In my last post I indicated I would be leading a walk at the Arboretum this Saturday April 26th. A family conflict arose however, so I won’t be able to lead the walk. My friend and frequent co-leader of bird walks, Andrew Joslin, has agreed to stand in for me so the walk will proceed as planned, weather permitting.

Most people are aware that late April and early May is the time when migrating warblers and other [passerine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine "passerine") birds arrive in Massachusetts. What many don’t realize however is that some of these warblers pass through in a matter of a few weeks, so this is the only time to see them in the spring. Some will re-appear briefly in the fall – on their return trip to Central and South America – but by then their bright breeding coloration is gone. Palm Warbler is a good example.

These pretty little birds are known for their habit of “tail-pumping” which helps to identify them in the field. Palm Warblers will be gone by mid-May, moving on to breeding grounds farther north, so this is the time to see them. There will be other nice birds on Saturday as well:

So please join Andrew if you can. And don’t forget my next walk which will be on Saturday May 3 starting from the Peter’s Hill Gate off Bussey Street at 8AM.

Good Birding!
