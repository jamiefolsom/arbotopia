Some of you may have searched for my arbotopia blog this fall and been unable to find it or log in.  The backstory is that due to a number of mistakes on my part the hosting service for arbotopia shut it down at the beginning of September.  With help from friends and family more tech conversant than I, the old posts have been mostly restored.  There are occasional missing links, images that haven't been properly loaded and audio recordings that don't work but I hope these will be gradually corrected up the road. More importantly, the blog is now registered with a new content management system and is up and running again.

I missed a number of good sightings during the down time but wanted to mention a few.  In October I had a new warbler species in the Arboretum:

A lovely Cape May Warbler in fall plumage

And  at the end of October a flock of finches showed up on Bussey Hill:

This Purple Finch is either a female or an immature male; they are both the same color

This rosy Purple Finch is definitely a male

The flock remained for about two weeks, eating flowers from an exotic Asian tree

On the last day of 2018 another uncommon bird, a White-crowned Sparrow, showed up at the feeding station in the Arboretum:

The White-crowned Sparrow has a clear breast, brown and tan striped head and orange beak as seen above.
