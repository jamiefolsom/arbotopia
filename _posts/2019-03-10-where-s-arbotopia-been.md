Some of you may have searched for my arbotopia blog this fall and been unable to find it or log in.  The backstory is that due to a number of mistakes on my part the hosting service fro arbotopia shut it down at the beginning of September.  With help  form friends and family more tech conversant than I, the old posts have been mostly restored There are occasional missing links, images that haven't been properly loaded and audio recordings that don't work but these will be gradually found and corrected up the road I hope. More importantly, the blog is now registered with a new content management system and is again up and running.
