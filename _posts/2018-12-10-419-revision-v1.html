<p>Well below freezing temperatures greeted the nearly forty birders on Sunday December 9th for a walk around the ponds and landscape&nbsp; of the middle Emerald Necklace.&nbsp; As we began I mentioned that a Mandarin Duck, present in one of the water features in Central Park, NYC that was getting a lot of national press lately had been seen here five years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>This male Mandarin Duck, seen&nbsp; to left of it's cousin a male Wood Duck, hung out on Leverett Pond with a flotilla of Wood Ducks for several weeks in winter 2013</figcaption>

<p>It too had been declared an "escape", an Asian duck that had wandered from someone's private property and therefore not countable for birders life lists.&nbsp; Still pretty fancy to see though.</p>





<p>Because of constant freezing temperatures in the last two days much of Leverett Pond was iced over, but we found pockets of open water and they were full of waterfowl.&nbsp; Resident Canada Geese and Mallards predominated, but as we scanned the collection other species were identified, including these:</p>

<p>Like many of the duck species that appear here only in winter, these ducks breed in the upper US and southern Canada.&nbsp; </p>





<p>Then&nbsp; we spotted our target species for this pond, the beautiful Wood Duck:</p>

<p>Wood ducks began being seen on this pond at the turn of the century and since then their numbers in winter have greatly expanded. One experienced local birder who was along for the walk said he counted close to 100 Wood Ducks here about five years ago and breeding was documented&nbsp; in this busy urban area for this usually skittish species in 2015:</p>

<p>The female of the species, while more subtile in coloration, is equally beautiful:</p>

<p>Our birds today were mostly sleeping, but later began to move about:</p>

<p>Hard to get enough of these beauties.&nbsp; &nbsp;While we were scanning the duck population I noticed a bird in a bare tree at pond's edge:</p>

<p>This was our best unexpected bird on the walk and was a lifer for some.&nbsp; He sat for us in the tree, occasionally diving into the pond for a fish, for ten minutes made his rattling call several times.</p>





<p>Just as we were about to&nbsp;</p>
