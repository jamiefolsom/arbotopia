<p>Birding in the Arnold Arboretum in mid March is an exercise in unchecked optimism, weather denial or just plain madness.  Only a few migratory birds have arrived in Massachusetts by then and most of those are not common at any time in our landscape.  Nonetheless I led a walk this chilly but dry morning and thirteen equally mad people showed up.  We actually had a nice walk and saw most of what is available at this time of year in the Arboretum.  We could have encountered a woodcock or even a killdeer–  but we didn’t.  We walked “the pipe” through the wet meadow looking for snipe– but came up empty.  I did have one in the conifer section of the AA three weeks ago though; a great looking bird with a fantastic bill:</p>

<p>In my promo for today’s walk I promised we would see the avian harbinger of spring, and that proved true.  Here is a shot of one of them:</p>

<p>Only the males arrive early and they have been here since March 1st.  After territory has been established, the females will arrive and sort out who gets who and what.</p>

<p>We of course looked for the Eastern Screech-Owl that I discussed in my <a href="http://www.arbotopia.com/arboretum-owls-update-2014/">last post</a> but it seems to have moved on to another location; perhaps it is seeking a mate elsewhere in the Arboretum.</p>

<p>Although we had no unusual birds, everyone in the group got good looks at the birds we saw. The list included:</p>
