<p>In my<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004090603/http://www.arbotopia.com/how-rare-is-rare-a-butterfly-tale/">&nbsp;last post</a>&nbsp;I promised a followup on the Pipevine Swallowtail caterpillars that the Arboretum staff and I had collected and placed in inclosures back in late July. Here is a shot of some of them&nbsp;in their last stage, or instar;</p>

<p>I went away for a brief vacation and when I returned six&nbsp;days later, all three of my cats had pupated and formed complex&nbsp;chrysalides:</p>

<p>The other two chrysalides, seen sideways, attached to the wall of the inclosure.</p>





<p>I had missed the transformation! &nbsp;When I went to the Visitor&rsquo;s Center at the Arboretum I discovered that they had about 12&nbsp;chrysalides in their inclosure as well. &nbsp;Now the question was whether these pupae would remain as&nbsp;chrysalides and &ldquo;over-winter&rdquo; before becoming butterflies (enclosuring), or if they would convert this fall, probably in September.</p>





<p>In mid August I went on another weeks vacation and while there I got a message from the Arb that two of their&nbsp;chrysalides had eclosed.&nbsp; Upon my return I went immediately to my little cage and found a lovely Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly anxious to&nbsp;escape:</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later it was flying free in the Arboretum!</p>





<p>Over the next several weeks the &ldquo;rare&rdquo; Pipevine Swallowtail was being seen all over the grounds, as six of the Arb&rsquo;s&nbsp;chrysalides had eclosed as well:</p>

<p>We were not able to determine if any of them had mated and laid eggs. &nbsp;There are still eight&nbsp;chrysalides that have not eclosed and we will try to successfully hold them over the winter in a variety of settings- outdoors and exposed, outdoors but covered and protected and indoors in an unheated environment- and await the coming of spring and hopefully another batch of butterflies&nbsp;for release.</p>





<p>On August 25 I had a swallowtail&nbsp;home run; all five species present in a grouping of the same flowering shrub,&nbsp;Harlequin Glorybower&nbsp;<em>Clerodendrum trichotomum. &nbsp;</em>The Giant Swallowtail that has eluded me in Massachusetts finally appeared, just as&nbsp;the battery in my camera died! &nbsp;I had to settle for a lousy shot of the lep on my old iPhone:</p>

<p>It has been a BIG butterfly summer.</p>





<p>But now it is time to turn our attention back to birds. &nbsp;This beauty, captured on the same bushes with&nbsp;the butterflies, helped me make the switch:</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;hummingbirds&nbsp;are heading south right now so there won&rsquo;t be any to be seen on my up-coming fall bird walks. But I&rsquo;m hoping a few warblers or&nbsp;other late migrants might still be around. &nbsp;Here are the dates:</p>





<p>Saturday 9/30 8AM starting from&nbsp;the Main Gate on the Arborway.</p>





<p>Saturday 10/14 8AM starting from&nbsp;the Peters Hill Gate on Bussey Street.</p>





<p>Check the Arboretum&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004090603/https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/">website</a>&nbsp;for a map&nbsp;or to download a checklist.</p>





<p>Good birding!<br></p>
