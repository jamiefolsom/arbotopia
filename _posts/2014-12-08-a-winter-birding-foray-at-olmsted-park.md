About 15 birders joined me and National Park Ranger Mark Swartz for a walk along [Leverett Pond and through Olmsted Park up to Ward’s Pond](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Olmsted+Park/@42.3251659,-71.1152747,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e3799e7cec8f07:0x23a597f711bb181f) and back.  It was cold and damp following the heavy rains overnight but the group was in good spirits, even though the avian harvest was far from abundant.

We began by searching for the Wood Ducks that have been hanging out on the Boston side of one of the small islands in Leverett.  The water was so high from the rains it was hard to find the island!  But after a search we did manage to discover a few “woodies” among the sunken shrubbery.  Near the end of the walk we were lucky enough to see a beautiful pair close up.  The Wood Duck may be the most spectacular native duck in this area:

As we were admiring the Wood Ducks, several Ring-necked Ducks passed by:

Then someone in the group noticed a pair of Hooded Mergansers hiding in the aquatic undergrowth:

After this hat trick we spent a few minutes comparing female Mallards and American Black Ducks, which can be confusing.

Our search for land birds was disappointing.  Other than the usual winter species- robins, titmouses, chickadees, and several sparrow species- we came up short.  The youngest member of our group, perhaps ten years old,  treated us to his perfect rendition of the call of the Mourning Dove.  No real MODO’s responded however.  As we circled Ward’s Pond we did have one Hermit Thrush hidden in a tangled bittersweet vine.  This is a lovely bird:

The other nice surprise was two Great Blue Herons hunkered down in the reeds around that pond.  Seeing them up close demonstrated how big these birds are:

Both herons flushed briefly while we were passing by, giving us another view of their impressive size:

A few days before the walk Mark and I made a scouting tour of the area and we located a somewhat uncommon bird at Ward’s Pond. Of course we were anxious to find it for the group, but it was not to be.  Winter Wrens are notorious skulkers, hiding deftly in the underbrush.  Other birders had reported the wren in this location off and on for at least a month prior to the walk.  Perhaps it had moved on, but more likely it was there, watching us listen and search.  Here is an image of the bird taken on our scouting trip:

This tiny wren carries a big stick when it comes to vocalization however. Here is it’s lovely call (sung mostly in the spring):

Good birding!
