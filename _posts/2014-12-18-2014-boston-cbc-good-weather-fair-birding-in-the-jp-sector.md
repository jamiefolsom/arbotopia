This year’s Boston Christmas Bird Count went off without a hitch on Sunday December 12th; last year’s count had to be postponed because of a bad snowstorm.  No weather problems this year, but the birding did not match the weather.  This was the 114th CBC in the Jamaica Plain sector.  We fielded eight birders to work the birding hot spots from the Landmark Center on the Riverway up the Emerald Necklace thru Franklin Park, including Forest Hills Cemetery and ending up at Mass Audubon’s Boston Nature Center in Mattapan.  A hardy (or foolish) threesome from the group began at 4:30 AM seeking owls; they then joined the others at Jamaica Pond at 7:00 AM and we finished up at 3:00 PM.  Later that evening a final listing of all the birds seen in the 15 mile diameter Boston circle was compiled.

The Jamaica Plain species count was 49 for the day.  The species with the highest numbers in JP was Canada Goose –1169 to be exact.  Most of those were found on the golf course in Franklin Park; local golfers will not be happy to hear that!  We also tallied 82 robins, 59 chickadees and 45 doves.  Some of our “best” birds were a Gadwall duck and a House Wren, both in Franklin Park.  Other “good” birds were seen in the Arnold Arboretum.  Oddly, three of them were found within six feet of each other;  Orange-crowned Warbler, Hermit Thrush and Gray Catbird. Catbirds are a very common migratory bird in Boston during the spring and summer, but by early fall they all head south . All but this one- it was the only catbird seen in Boston in this year’s CBC!  Stragglers like this have a very tough haul to reach the spring sunshine; he or she will probably perish over the long cold winter.  That tempers the excitement of finding an out-of-season bird.

Just as there were some great finds in JP, there were unexpected misses as well.  Most surprising, the two hours of “owling” in the early dawn came up empty.  We seldom fail to find at least a few Eastern Screech-owls and Great Horned Owls on the JP CBC.  This doesn’t mean they weren’t there, just that they didn’t respond to imitations of their calls or show themselves in the developing light.  One of our group, who lives on the edge of Forest Hills Cemetery, actually heard two Great Horned Owls calling to each other just two days after the Sunday count.  Note that this year Boston had an all time high count for Great Horned Owl- 18.

Below is the official list of birds recorded in the full Boston Count. I have highlighted some of the special birds that our local group added to the count.  All of this information will be compiled into a data set for all of [North America and much of Central and South America.](http://birds.audubon.org/american-birds-annual-summary-christmas-bird-count)

The CBC provides highly significant information on those bird species that are increasing in number or becoming endangered, as well as showing geographic shifts in response to climate change or habitat loss.

Here is the BCBC list and summary, compiled by Bob Stymeist who has been leading this effort for many years:

**Greater Boston Christmas Bird Count**

The 42nd Greater Boston Christmas Bird Count (CBC) (actually the 114th- Belmont, **Jamaica Plain** and Winchester have been covered since the very first CBC in 1900!)  was held yesterday  with very nice weather conditions. We recorded 120 species and so far there were an additional NINE species that were seen within count period.  We added ONE new species to the overall list- a Semipalmated Plover that was found and photographed on Thompson Island, this brings the total number of species seen on the Boston CBC to 229!
We had all time high counts for: Cackling Goose-2, Northern Shoveler-11 Ruddy Duck-310, Wild Turkey-125, Common Loon-107, Peregrine Falcon-11, Great Horned Owl-18, Downy Woodpecker-382, Northern Flicker-46, White-breasted Nuthatch-358, Carolina Wren-115, House Wren-3, Winter Wren- 11, and Orange-crowned Warbler-8

There were many highlights and as always the case a few birds that were surprisingly missed: Cackling Goose 2 at Clay Pit Pond, Belmont, Harlequin Duck in Winthrop, the Barrow’s Goldeneye from Deer Island, Rough-legged Hawk 2 from Saugus, the Semipalmated Plover on Thompson Island, 14 Snowy Owls (13 at Logan, 1 in Saugus), House Wrens in three areas, and an Indigo Bunting in Newton. Big misses were; Lesser Scaup, Sanderling, and Bonaparte’s Gull.
