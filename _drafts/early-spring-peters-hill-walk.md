Over 30 people appeared on Saturday in the overcast morning light, trying to discern color in warblers flitting high in he trees; it wasn't easy.  But the rain held off until the end and we had some nice birds including early migrants and nesters.  We started off listening to a Chipping Sparrow as I spoke about the difficulty distinguishing it from the early migrant Pine Warbler; more on that later.  Our first sight of an active nest was bizarre.  I showed the group an obvious oriole nest, but orioles had just arrived in Boston a few days earlier so what could this complete nest be except last years holdover?  What I had noticed on a scouting trip was another bird was using the nest for it's own purpose, a chickadee!

This Black-capped chickadee has taken over an old Baltimore Oriole nest for is own nesting site.

I had watched a pair of chickadees enter and leave the nest carrying moss to line their own nest. At the end of the walk we revisited this unusual sight and the whole group got to watch the chickadeesin action.
