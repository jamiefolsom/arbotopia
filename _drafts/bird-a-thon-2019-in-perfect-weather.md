As you all know the weather this spring has been underwhelming, except perhaps for ducks.  But the spirits of nature smiled on Mass Audubon with a mostly sunny and rainless day for their annual fund raising event, Bird-a-thon (BAT).  I was fortunate to go out this year as part of a nicely balanced trio;

A relatively novice young birder with sharp eyes and ears and the determined curiosity and perseverance to find the bird behind the subtle movement high in the tree or deep in the thicket.

A middle-aged guy who caught the birder bug fairly recently but who has since become totally obsessed; and who birds with a SLR camera & 500 mm lens instead of binoculars, seeing thru the lens while simultaneously recording the sighting for others to review.

An octogenarian with lots of stored avian information; desiring to connect with his environment, but hampered by deteriorating senses, slowed reflexes and compromised mobility.

Put these abilities together with nice weather and the motivation of backing a great organization at a time when support for the environment is critical, and you have a chance to break 100 species for the day.  We fell short, but only by thirteen!

Half of our catch was in urban Boston including all sixteen species of migrating warblers, some of which were seen in multiple locations.  The other two in our group worked over Millennium Park in West Roxbury starting at the 6 PM kickoff time Friday night, and we all started Saturday at 6 AM at McLaughlin Woods on Mission Hill.  We closed out the day at Franklin Park where we picked up another vireo and two thrush species. We also spent some time south of Boston at Daniel Webster Wildlife Sanctuary and the Trustees of Reservations site at World's End. Highlights were the nice list of warblers, an Eastern Screech-owl in Franklin Park, two Glossy Ibis over-flying Daniel Webster and, in the same locale, a wonderful display of noisy Bobolinks.

Here are some images from/about the day:

So far the Boston Nature Center has raised over $7500 toward their goal of ten thousand dollars, and our small team contributed a thousand of that total.  Thanks to all who contributed;  there is still time to donate on [my  donor site](https://tinyurl.com/y67rsjk6).

Finally I want to note another recent birding event, Global Big Day.  This year on 4 May, 32,500 people ventured outside in 171 countries, finding 6,816 species: 2/3rds of the world's bird species in a single day. This is a new world record for the number of people birding on a single day as recorded by [eBird](https://ebird.org/home).

The spring migration is in full swing! Get out and bird, or join me on my last two walks this coming weekend:
