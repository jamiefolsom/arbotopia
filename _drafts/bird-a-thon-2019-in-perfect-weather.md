As you all know the weather this spring has been underwhelming, except perhaps for ducks.  But the spirits of nature smiled on Mass Audubon with a mostly sunny and rainless day for their annual fund raising event, Bird-a-thon (BAT).  I was fortunate to go out this year as part of a well balenced trio;  

A relatively novice young birder with sharp eyes and ears and a determined curiosity and persistence to find the bird behind the subtile movement high in the tree or deep in the thicket.

A middle-aged guy who caught the birder bug fairly recently but who has since become totally obsessed; and who birds with a SLR camera  w 500 mm lens instead of binoculars, seeing thru the lens while simutaneously recording the sighting for others to review.

A octogenerean with lots of stored avain information, desiring to connect with his environment, but hampered by deteriating senses, slowed refelexes and compromised mobility.

Put these abilities together with nice weather and motivation of backing a great organization at a time when support for the environment is critical and you have a chance to get more than 100 species for the day.  We fell short, but only by thirteen!
