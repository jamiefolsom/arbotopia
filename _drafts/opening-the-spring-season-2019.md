This weekend I led walks at the ArnoldArboretum and nearby Leverett Pond and Olmsted Park on the Emerald Necklace to try to find some early birds in the spring migration.  In many ways the walks were similar; we missed the recurrent rains of this belated spring, but the weather was less than perfect for both walks Despite that, about 20 birders joined the walk on both days and we ended up seeing about the sane number of species as well. On Saturday April 27th, accompanied by 19 birders and my co-leader Brendan Keegan, I walked from the Main entrance of the Arboretum to the top of Bussey Hill and back through the Shrub & Vine Garden to our start. There had been heavy rain overnight and the temperature was 40 with brisk winds- not an auspicious beginning.
