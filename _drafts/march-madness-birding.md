<p>Birding in the Arnold Arboretum in mid March is an exercise in unchecked optimism, weather denial or just plain madness.&nbsp; Only a few migratory birds have arrived in Massachusetts by then and most of those are not common at any time in our landscape.&nbsp; Nonetheless I led a walk this chilly but dry morning and thirteen equally mad people showed up.&nbsp; We actually had a nice walk and saw most of what is available at this time of year in the Arboretum.&nbsp; We could have encountered a woodcock or even a killdeer&ndash;&nbsp; but we didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We walked &ldquo;the pipe&rdquo; through the wet meadow looking for snipe&ndash; but came up empty.&nbsp; I did have one in the conifer section of the AA three weeks ago though; a great looking bird with a fantastic bill:</p>

<p>In my promo for today&rsquo;s walk I promised we would see the avian harbinger of spring, and that proved true.&nbsp; Here is a shot of one of them:</p>

<p>Only the males arrive early and they have been here since March 1st.&nbsp; After territory has been established, the females will arrive and sort out who gets who and what.</p>





<p>We of course looked for the Eastern Screech-Owl that I discussed in my&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140426104415/http://www.arbotopia.com/arboretum-owls-update-2014/">last post</a>&nbsp;but it seems to have moved on to another location; perhaps it is seeking a mate elsewhere in the Arboretum.</p>





<p>Although we had no unusual birds, everyone in the group got good looks at the birds we saw. The list included:</p>
