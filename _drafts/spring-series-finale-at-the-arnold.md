<p>On Saturday morning I led the last of five spring bird walks at the Arnold Arboretum; 46 people showed up to get a glimpse of the tail end of the migration and enjoy the beautiful weather and some spectacular trees.&nbsp; I began the walk with my docent hat on; discussing the Tuliptree in full bloom in front of the main gate. What a lovely flower this Asian x American cross was displaying:</p>

<p>Tuliptree&nbsp;<em>Liriodendron tulipifera x L. chinense</em>&nbsp;584-81-A</p>





<p>By then we had heard or seen several birds, including a flyover Great Blue Heron.&nbsp; As we did the circle up to the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706071037/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/featured-plants/shrub-and-vine-garden/">Leventritt Shrub and Vine Garden</a>, past the lilacs and down to the ponds and back, we ticked off many of the resident birds and nesting migrants to be seen late in the spring.&nbsp; I had been seeing and hearing lots of Baltimore Orioles since the first of May, and several sharp-eyed birders were able to locate three active nests.&nbsp; Such lovely birds; and so talented in their nest-building skills:</p>

<p>Baltimore Oriole, male</p>





<p>Orioles were the bird of the day. We tried to find the other, much less common, oriole found in the Arboretum, but didn&rsquo;t succeed.&nbsp; If we had it would have looked like this:</p>

<p>Male Orchard Oriole. Note the chestnut color replacing the vivid orange of it&rsquo;s cousin the Baltimore Oriole above.</p>





<p>Early in the walk several small flocks of Cedar Waxwings flew by; a couple of them stopped for a distant look. Here&rsquo;s a close-up:</p>

<p>Cedar Waxwing</p>





<p>We heard two vireo species in the fully leafed out trees&ndash; Red-eyed and Warbling&nbsp;&ndash; but never saw one.&nbsp; The song of the Warbling Vireo is frequently heard in the Arboretum, where they nest every year. Here is a recording of it:</p>

<p>Red-bellied Woodpeckers were also heard in several locations.&nbsp; It is a bird worth searching for:</p>

<p>We also inspected several of the fifteen nest boxes that are scattered about on the AA grounds.&nbsp; In one of the boxes in Leventritt Garden we caught a House Wren peering out of the hole before it flew.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t disturb the nest, but here is what we might have seen if we had:</p>

<p>House Wren nestlings. The stick nest is typical of the species. This image was taken in 2006 during a survey of nest boxes. No birds were harmed during this survey!</p>

<p>Those who joined the walk, and who scan this list carefully, will note the absence of a bird we thought we identified. High up in a tree I spotted a small bird which I initially thought was a flycatcher in the Empid. group.&nbsp; As some of us zeroed in on the distant bird we thought it showed a yellow rump before it flew, and declared it a Yellow-rumped Warbler.&nbsp; I commented that this was unusual since this warbler,&nbsp;common during the migration, should be long gone farther north by now.&nbsp; When I put the bird in the eBird system it brought me up short; &ldquo;details please&rdquo;, as this would be a rare sighting in Suffolk County at the end of May.&nbsp; They wanted a full description of the sighting, or a photograph.&nbsp; I&nbsp; reflected on the sighting and decided that in fact we had not seen this bird well enough for a certain identification, and deleted the bird from our list.&nbsp; Birding operates mostly on the honor system and most birders are honest.&nbsp; Like the cruiser sitting at the traffic light,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706071037/http://ebird.org/content/ebird/">eBird</a>&nbsp;helps to keep us that way.</p>





<p>At the start of the walk, to whet the group&rsquo;s appetite, I mentioned a Scarlet Tanager had been sighted close to our start just two days earlier.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t see it, but here is an image I took two weeks ago in nearby Franklin Park:</p>

<p>Maybe next year!</p>





<p>This was the last spring walk for the season.&nbsp; Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706071037/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/">Arboretum website</a>&nbsp;later in the summer for the fall schedule of walks.</p>





<p>Good birding!</p>
