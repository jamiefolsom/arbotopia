It was a crisp but bright morning when four early birders joined me for a two hour walk at the Boston Nature Center in Mattapan.  I first birded this location in my free time way back in 1969 when I was a second year resident in psychiatry at Tufts New England Medical Center. All of the teaching hospitals had a unit at the then Boston State Hospital on that site.   Those buildings were demolished decades ago and Mass Audubon built its eco-friendly headquarters on 68 acres of the much larger hospital tract.  It has lots of varied habitat and as it is maintained in a casual way in contrast the the Arnold Arboretum and other birdy locations here about.   The BNC is renowned for its healthy flock of Wild Turkeys; we probably saw more than a dozen often displaying their stuff:

I was hoping for another target bird this morning.  Killdeers have nested in the victory gardens on the property almost very spring but today they were not to be seen; too bad as they are a nice bird:

You have to look closely to see the four well camouflaged eggs beneath this Killdeer that nested in the gardens in 2015

The "frequent flyer" that we did see- everywhere- was Baltimore Oriole.  We saw at least a dozen, mostly males:

Mass Audubon's Boston Nature Center is a special place for experiencing nature close up within the urban environment. They have many programs focused on kids including a certified pre-school, school vacation and summer day camps, and other activities year around. They deserve everyone's support. One way is to support the Center's [Bird-a-thon](http://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/birds-birding/bird-a-thon) team, which will join other Mass Audubon birding groups throughout the Commonwealth, competing to see and hear as many birds as possible beginning at 6PM Friday May 10th for the next 24 hours. I'll be part of the Boston team.
