<p>Posted on January 14, 2013</a></p>





<p>This morning my birding colleague Andrew Joslin and I led a bird walk along Meadow Road in the Arnold Arboretum for about two hours.&nbsp; We were joined by more than 25 enthusiastic birders, many of whom were just testing their wings in the wonderful avocation of birding.&nbsp; Although the weather was a bit damp, neither the birds nor the birders were discouraged and we had some nice sightings.&nbsp; A Red-breasted Nuthatch at the feeders near the Administration Building was a &ldquo;life bird&rdquo; for several in the group. A Red-tailed Hawk posed in the giant Silver Maple farther down the road for all to admire. A Carolina Wren began to call loudly from the wetland.&nbsp; Most of us never saw this tiny wren but it&rsquo;s call is unmistakable.&nbsp; How such a small bird can emit this intense call always amazes me!</p>

<p>As we continued down to the cork trees and the buckeyes we added to our list of woodpecker species with a Red-bellied Woodpecker, a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker and a Northern Flicker.&nbsp; The sapsucker disappeared after a brief stop and was not seen by all,&nbsp; which was too bad as it is a stunning bird &ndash; here is an image of one I took last spring in my side yard:</p>

<p>A member of the group located a lovely Golden-crowned Kinglet, a bird seen much more often in the winter than at any other time.&nbsp; Everyone had good looks at this diminutive beauty as it flitted about on a low shrub.&nbsp; Overall we saw 26 species. Here is the list, with approximate counts for each:</p>

<p>You will note that the list was compiled using&nbsp;eBird, an innovative online checklist program that is free for registered users.&nbsp; It provides a convenient way to both record your sightings and share them with the birding community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ebird.org/home">Check it out!</a></p>





<p>There will be a series of bird walks in the Arb this spring and again in the fall. Stay tuned for the details either on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/visit/">Arnold Arboretum website&nbsp;</a>or here on this blog.</p>





<p>Good birding!<br></p>
