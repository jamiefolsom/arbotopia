The 2020 Mass Bird-a-thon, dubbed the Bird-at-home-a-thon, Started Friday evening at 6PM and ended Saturday May 16 at 6PM.  The rules this year, consistent with the current pandemic lockdown, required birders to bird alone and go to sites reachable on foot.  I chose to bird my yard Friday night and part of Saturday, and to visit the Arnold Arboretum for about 6 hours on Saturday.  The weather couldn't have been better, and the birds cooperated.

I set my goal to get 40 or more species and ended up with 52.  The highlights were the warblers; both at home and in the AA.  I consider it a good day when I can identify by sight or sound ten species of the more than 20 warblers that pass thru eastern Massachusetts during the spring migration.  Yesterday I had 13 species in the Arb, mostly at the top of Bussey Hill.  More surprisingly I had 8 species in my 50 X 50 square foot side yard.  The Chestnut-sided Warbler I had there was not found in the Arboretum, so I ended up with a 14 species day. Here is an image of that little gem:

Other birds I picked up at home to add to my Arboretum list were a Ruby-throated Hummingbird that buzzed through the yard Friday evening while my wife and I were eating outdoors, twi American Crows that I suspect are nesting in a nearby tree, a lovely Veery skulking in the shrubbery;

and two feeder birds; White-breasted Nuthatch and Tufted Titmouse.

Highlights in the Arboretum other than the warblers included a nice Green Heron at the edge of Dawson Pond.

One of the big limiting factors in terms of finding new species this year was the absence of birding any wetlands or coastal areas, so it was nice to get at least one wading bird. Another waterbird that showed up was a female Mallard with a gaggle of youngsters in a vernal pond along Meadow Road.![](/images/p1090765.jpeg)
