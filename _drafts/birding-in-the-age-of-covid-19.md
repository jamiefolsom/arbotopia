The 2020 Mass Bird-a-thon, dubbed the Bird-at-home-a-thon, Started Friday evening at 6PM and ended Saturday May 16 at 6PM.  The rules this year, consistent with the current pandemic lockdown, required birders to bird alone and go to sites reachable on foot.  I chose to bird my yard Friday night and part of Saturday, and to visit the Arnold Arboretum for about 6 hours on Saturday.  The weather couldn't have been better, and the birds cooperated.
