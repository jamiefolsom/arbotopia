<p>Two dozen birders joined me on a beautiful morning for a walk from the main gate to Bussey Hill and back at the Arnold Arboretum. &nbsp;As the passerine&nbsp;migration begins to subside we were hoping for some warbler action, but it was not to be. &nbsp;A number of nesting Yellow Warblers were seen and heard throughout the walk, but the only other warbler was an American Redstart at the top of the hill.</p>

<p>American Redstart, male. The bird we had today was a less colorful female.</p>





<p>One member of the group heard a Common Yellowthroat, another warbler that nests in the Arboretum, but as no one else heard&nbsp;it, we kept with the &ldquo;two observers must&nbsp;see or&nbsp;hear for it to count&rdquo; birding rule. &nbsp;Warbling Vireos, a bird better heard than seen, were heard frequently, and seen less so:</p>

<p>The Warbling Vireo makes up for it&rsquo;s drab appearance with a delightful song.</p>





<p>Here is a recording of this bird&rsquo;s song:</p>

<p>Even more common than&nbsp;the vireos were Baltimore Orioles, and we saw several of their hanging nests:</p>

<p>Male Baltimore Oriole at nest. These woven nests are so sturdy they often last through the &nbsp;entire year.</p>





<p>Speaking of nests, we saw a number of robin nests; then we&nbsp;watched&nbsp;this bird fly to it&rsquo;s nest hole, pause briefly and call, then disappear into the hole!</p>

<p>As we walked up the grassy southern slope to the top of Bussey Hill, we spotted two flycatchers in the same tree; Eastern Phoebe and Eastern Kingbird. &nbsp;I posted images of these birds on my blog&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160725160650/http://www.arbotopia.com/an-urban-wild-in-the-arnold-arboretum/">last week</a>. &nbsp;At another location, two members of the group heard the distinct call of a&nbsp;different&nbsp;flycatcher, the Eastern Wood-pewee. &nbsp;These birds stay in the deep woods&nbsp;where they are usually identified by their song:</p>

<p>In a nearby tree we found a flock of Cedar Waxwings,&nbsp;dressed for a formal occasion:</p>

<p>Cedar Waxwing in it&rsquo;s pristine plumage.</p>





<p>I had taken the group to the Explorer&rsquo;s Garden near the top of the hill because I had had some good migrating birds there two days before. &nbsp;Today the only warbler was the Redstart mentioned&nbsp;earlier. &nbsp;I listened for the song of the&nbsp;Scarlet Tanager, but heard nothing. &nbsp;Then as we prepared&nbsp;to descend the hill I heard it. Then we saw it!</p>

<p>Scarlet Tanager, male.</p>





<p>This bird was a &ldquo;lifer&rdquo; for many in the group. &nbsp;Beyond that it was all downhill ornithologically as well as topographically&nbsp;. &nbsp;Except for the Wood Thrushes calling in the North Woods:</p>

<p>This was my last public bird walk this spring. &nbsp;Stay tuned for the fall!</p>
