The weather could not have been better, in contrast to most of this spring, and more than 40 people showed up for a nice walk from the main gate to Bussey Hill and return.  The walk started off with a bang; someone spotted a Magnolia Warbler:

We saw and later heard several Warbling Vireos on the walk.  I described how drab this vireo looks for those that missed it:

The only identification feature on this little bird is the faint white eyebrow, it makes up for its looks with a lovely rambling warble.

Also far up in the canopy was another drab bird, but with a distinct posture; a flycatcher for sure.  At the time I declared it a Least Flycatcher, but as it never called (the best way to distinguish this group of small flycatchers) I can't be sure so it was recorded as Empidonax species. 

Two hummingbirds zipped past the group at different points; no one got good looks but there is only one likely species in this area, Ruby-throated Hummingbird.  Here's a shot of one briefly at rest:

We saw evidence of breeding activity several times during the walk.  A White-breasted Nuthatch made several trips to its nesthole apparently bringing food to early nestlings.  A female Baltimore Oriole was found weaving its intricate hanging nest.

Tree Swallows were seen atop a nest box maintained by fellow birder and Arboretum staffer Brendan Keegan.  And we saw robins perched on nests in several spots.

Migrating warblers were present in small numbers but there was little singing even thought sun and mild wind seemed conducive for song.  We got pretty good looks at a Black and White Warbler:

And YellowWarblers were everywhere:
