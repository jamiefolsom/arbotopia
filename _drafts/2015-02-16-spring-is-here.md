Saturday was the annual January Arnold Arboretum bird walk and 30 people signed up on the Arboretum website.  When I awakened and saw the temperature at 12° F, I wondered if anyone would show up.  I got to the main gate at 9AM (Temp 16° F) and was greeted by 19 bundled-up birders, eager and ready to go!  Our first stop was the feeders next to the Hunnewell Building; maintained with funds from the 1912 Edward Whitney Bird Fund (more about that in a future post).  There was little bird activity in the trees and bushes on the grounds, but the feeders were hopping!  Nothing special; but this group of mostly beginning birders were delighted with close-up views of House Finches, American Goldfinches, cardinals and four sparrow species.  I also discussed the [“magic halo”](/2014/03/14/what-about-birdfeeders.html) I put around the feeders in December; it was doing it’s job.  All the House Sparrows were on the ground waiting for cast-offs from the birds at the feeders.

As we moved on, the birding went from active to nearly absent.  We picked up a Northern Mockingbird in the Leventritt Gardens that responded to my pishing:

We circled down Bussey Hill Road to the ponds which were solid ice.  I showed the group [last winter’s roosting hole](#) for an Eastern Screech-owl, but it was vacant.  As we walked past the hole however, a passerby reported there had been an owl in the hole earlier in the morning.  Arboretum birders, keep on the lookout!  We did find some open water farther along on the way back and there were several species in and around that “seep”, including about six of the more than 30 Mourning Doves we admired:

We finished up the walk studying a group of sparrows working the grass along the roadway.  At first these birds were hard to see even though they were only 20 feet or so from the road; they blended in very well in the spotty snow-covered off-brown grass.  Most of the birds were already on our list, but one “little brown job” stood out; plain grayish breast with a single central spot, black tail, prominent rusty cap.  It was our only American Tree Sparrow.

As the trip ended I mentioned that there was a very rare bird in a locale less than a mile from the Arboretum.  Some birders already knew about the Black-backed Woodpecker in Forest Hills Cemetery.  First found by Paul Peterson, a famous local birder, he posted the bird on January 6th.  There has been only a dozen reports of this species in the entire state in the last 40 years, and only four since 2000!  Dozens of birders looked for it through the week, without success.  On Friday morning however, another expert birder re-found it.  I headed to the cemetery that afternoon and joined more than 20 birders searching in vain for the bird; several had been there for more than two hours!  I left and went to the Arboretum to fill the feeders in preparation for the Saturday walk.  At about 3:30 PM I returned and found a very excited crowd getting excellent views of the target bird. Here is a photo of the woodpecker, marred by low light as it was taken late in the day:

Someone from the Arboretum walk group joined me to try for this bird at the cemetery.  To our delight, when we arrived there were several birders watching the woodpecker.  Experts on this species (seen rarely high in the mountains of New Hampshire, and uncommonly in the boreal and coniferous forests of Canada) predict that this bird may remain for weeks.
He has found a grove of dying hemlocks riddled by insects, just the thing for a hungry woodpecker!  The local list-servers, Massbird and BostonBirds, provide directions to the site in the cemetery, just off Magnolia Avenue.

Good luck, and Good Birding!

Actually NEAR, but I wanted to draw you all in.  This was the view out the window of my house Sunday morning :

![Half of the window frame is covered in snow](/images/IMG_1633.jpeg)

Trying to fight off major SAD, I thought I’d lay out a photo display of what we are all waiting for, beginning in a few weeks and running into April.  I’m focusing on flora, but can’t resist a few birds as well. I took all of these images in the Arnold Arboretum in recent years.

When the snow abates, we will see evidence of spring on the ground and in the trees, even in February.  Here is a very early example:

[![P1010131](/images/2015/02/P1010131.jpg)](/images/2015/02/P1010131.jpg)

Skunk Cabbage _Symplocarpus foetidus_. True to it’s latin name, the flower (seen left below) puts out a fetid odor; attracting ground beetles that act as pollinators while bees are dormant.

Pussy Willows begin to show themselves in February as well. Here is one type:

Rosegold Pussy Willow _Salix gracilistyla_

And here is a neat black form, also found along Meadow Road in the Arboretum:

[![P1070262](/images/2015/02/P1070262.jpg)](/images/2015/02/P1070262.jpg)

_Salix gracilistyla var. melanostachys_

Even more typical flowering plants can bloom in February.  I took this image on this very date in 2012.  I hope it isn’t in flower today!

The landscape can be quite altered in spring.  This is what Faxon Pond looked like on April 1, 2010

Heavy spring rains caused major flooding of the man-made ponds at the Arboretum in 2010. With all this snow we could have a repeat this year.

These next bulbs incorporate snow in their common names, hinting at their early display:

Snowdrops _Galanthus_ sps.

Soon some of the lawns below Bussey Hill will look like this:

The earliest migrating birds appear in the cattail marsh along Meadow Road in February.

But it will take at least another month for this beauty to show itself!

By April, many flowering trees will erupt into bloom.  Maples are not known for their floral display, but up close their early blooms can be spectacular:

Silver Maple _Acer saccharinum_

Another April bloomer, with tiny but magnificent flowers, can be seen beyond the _Tilia_collection along Meadow Road:

Japanese Cornel Dogwood _Cornus officinalis_

This early March flowering shrub was cloned at the Arnold Arboretum in 1928, and was given the name “Arnold Promise:

Here is it’s lovely flower close up:

Another early bloomer, fragrant as is the Witch Hazel above, is the Spicebush:

Japanese Spicebush _Lindera obtusiloba_, showing it’s handsome bark as well as it’s inflorescence.

Early spring can bring out beauty in emerging leaves as well; here are two examples:

At the Rose Garden, April really brings in the color:

All those blossoms bring out the insects:

Can spring be that far away?  My spring series of bird walks will begin on Saturday April  18th beginning at the main gate at 8AM.  See the [AA website](http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/) for more information.

In the meantime, stay warm!
