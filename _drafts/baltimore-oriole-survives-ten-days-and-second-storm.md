<p>The female Baltimore Oriole that appeared at my feeders on the day of the big storm of February 8th continues to the present and has survived another storm.

<p>Fortunately we have some HoneyBell oranges left over from a holiday gift and going downhill.&nbsp; Nothing like a sugar high at the end of the day to build up some calories for the long, cold winter night.</p>
