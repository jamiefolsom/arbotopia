While I have been into nature almost all my life, I got into birding in the '80's and used to go to Mass Audubon's Joppa Flats Wildlife Sanctuary  for Wednesday Morning Birding every spring. The Director of Joppa at that time, Bill Gette, led a three hour walk on Plum Island and other good birding locations in Essex County and it was there that I really got hooked on birding.   Thus it was a special treat when I led a walk with...

There were 12 enthusiastic birders and we did our best to find birds close to noon and at the close of spring migration.  Kicking off the walk were two lovely Cedar Waxwings:

Our waxwings were showing the bright red tips on the wing feathers as in this image, and the black mask and yellow terminal tail band

At the end of the walk a keen-eyed birder found the bird's nest in a nearby tree hawthorn tree!  We also viewed an old oriole nest where I had caught a pair of chickadees building within it several weeks ago.  On closer inspection today the old nest was empty and was bottomless. Either a predator attacked or the chickadees misjudged how much weight the well built, but year old, nest could support.
