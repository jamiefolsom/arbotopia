With temperatures in the low 30s and some wind I was unsure of the turnout for my first Arnold Arboretum walk in the new year. More than 50 hardy souls showed up nonetheless!

We ticked off a couple of resident species as we gathered at the front gate, including a nice look at our only mockingbird of the day:

This image displays the long tail and white wing patch distinctive of the Northern Mockingbird.

We headed for the feeding station near the Visitor Center and found a few more birds, including a large contingent of House Finches on the feeders as well as the nearby trees:

Encouraged by the nice collection of birds o n or near the feederswe set off for a walk down Meadow Road, up Forcithia Path and up to the top of Bussey Hill. We then descended the hill and followed along Oak Path back to the roadway and then through Leventritt Shrub and Vine Garden and back to to the Visitors Center; almost two miles. In that entire route we saw no more than half a dozen birds total!  There were virtually no avian creatures! The one interesting bird spotted by one of our group was a Golden-crowned Kinglet:

This is the "winter kinglet" in our area, almost never seen other than in late fall and winter.  Our bird today flitted about in an evergreen tree at first but then hopped up into a bare tree giving all good looks.

I was ready to declare the walk more of a winter exercise walk than a bird walk when we began to pick up a few birds in the trees above the Hunnewell slope as well as under a nice leafed out shrub.  Song Sparrow, White-throated Sparrow, Northern Cardinal. Someone called out "sapsucker" and after some searching I was able to get on the bird along with half of the group. It was an immature bird:

Immature Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, showing only a hint of red on the head but with a tinge of yellow on the breast.

A few members of the group, including my co-leader Brendan, saw yet another one of this uncommon species that was showing the full patterning of the bird:

I took this photo of a male Yellow-bellied Sapsucker a few years ago in my yard in Jamaica Plain; the rows of small holes in the bark of the yew tree are made by this woodpecker to get sap and attract insects to the sap as well.

We spent some time back at the feeders where we
