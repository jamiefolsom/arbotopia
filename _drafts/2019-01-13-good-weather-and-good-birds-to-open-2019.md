There was a huge turnout for the first Arboretum bird walk in the new year; more than fifty people showed up hoping start their year list with some regular winter species as well as some rarities.  We were not disappointed.   The walk started at the feeding station near the Administration Building but there were few birds on the feeders. One nice one made a brief appearance and was seen by some.

As we moved along Meadow Road the birding picked up. Beneath some shrubs we located a group of sparrows, and among them was an uncommon one:

There were several White-Throated Sparrows and a Song Sparrow in the mix, providing a great  chance to compare and contrast:

We saw or heard three species of woodpecker, including this uncommon one:

After we got to the ponds, which were almost completely iced over, we returned ticking of some other resident and winter birds, including a Northern Mockingbird:

A couple of us got a quick look at this tiny beauty, a Golden-crowned Kinglet:

This is the "winter kinglet"; the other in this group is seen more often in warmer weather:

They are fast-moving gems; hard to see and photograph.

Here is our nice list for this winter walk:
