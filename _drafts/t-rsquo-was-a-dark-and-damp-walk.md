<p>Eight birders gathered this morning in&nbsp;light drizzle after the heavy overnight rains . &nbsp;The plan was to bird Peters Hill, but I elected to start the walk on Hemlock Hill hoping to avoid some&nbsp;of the rain. &nbsp;We were in search of the Pine Warblers that have nested there for many years:</p>

<p>We may have ducked some of the rain, but the tradeoff was very poor light in the dense conifer forest. We heard several pines:</p>

<p>We were eventually able to get glimpses of the bird high in a White Pine. &nbsp;This was the first of several&nbsp;disappointing warbler experiences.</p>





<p>A Northern Flicker was the only woodpecker we sighted on the walk:</p>

<p>Northern Flicker</p>





<p>We did hear several Red-bellied Woodpeckers:</p>





<p>Their call is so distinctive that one doesn&rsquo;t need to see the bird to check it off on the list.</p>





<p>After spending a lot of time trying to see a Scarlet Tanager that we thought might be singing&nbsp;high in the canopy, I&nbsp;eventually decided it was just a noisy, and harsh, American Robin. These two birds songs, as well as that of the beautiful Rose-breasted Grosbeak, are easily confused.</p>





<p>We left the darkness of Hemlock Hill and proceeded to Peters Hill; I was hoping we might come upon some of the 8 species of warblers I had there just 48 hours earlier. &nbsp;We did pick up a&nbsp;new species; Great Crested Flycatcher;</p>

<p>Great-crested Flycatcher is the largest of this avian family and the noisiest:</p>





<p>The warblers were not visible, and barely audible, &nbsp;but we did hear a few as the list shows. &nbsp;We spent the rest of the walk admiring Baltimore Orioles and Red-winged Blackbirds as they moved about the meadow. We also saw two avian&nbsp;gangsters:</p>

<p>Female (top) and male Brown-headed Cowbirds</p>





<p>Cowbirds are brood parasites; rather than building their own nests they lay their eggs in the&nbsp;nests of others. &nbsp;Many&nbsp;species, including some endangered warblers, seem not to care or notice, and raise the intruder as if it was their own. &nbsp;Here is an image of a Yellow Warbler nest:</p>


<p><!-- wp:image {"id":257} --></p>
 <img src="/images/2018/11/P1090613.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-257"/> 





<p>This Yellow Warbler nest includes a warbler egg plus the larger, more speckled, egg of a cowbird and two recently hatched young.</p>





<p>This regrettable adaptation includes a relatively short incubation time, giving the intruder a head start&nbsp;in the competition for food. &nbsp;Young cowbirds have been known to push the adoptive&nbsp;species young out of the nest as well. &nbsp;Unpleasant business in nature at times!</p>





<p>Here is the complete list for our wet walk:</p>
