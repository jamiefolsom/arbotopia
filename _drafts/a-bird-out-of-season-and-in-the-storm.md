<p>The feeders in my side yard in Jamaica Plain get pretty good action during the winter.&nbsp; Over the years I have recorded 28 species drawn to the free lunch, including some less common ones like this Red-breasted Nuthatch:</p>

<p>On February 8th, the day that Blizzard 2013 began, I was watching a flurry of activity at the feeders, a typical pre-storm surge.&nbsp; I noticed a bird that had some yellow coloration; an American Goldfinch perhaps?&nbsp; On closer inspection the bird was too big for a goldfinch, and the bill was too thin.&nbsp; After further observation, and a check of my bird guides, I determined it was a Baltimore Oriole!</p>

<p>In early May, Baltimore Orioles begin to arrive from as far away as Central America to charm us with their rich, whistling song and bright colors.&nbsp; Their hanging basket shaped nests are easily recognized in the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171113123615/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/">Arnold Arboretum</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere.</p>

<p>But in early fall both the adults and their new young head south.&nbsp; That is they are supposed to head south.&nbsp; The female bird at my feeder didn&rsquo;t get it right.&nbsp; She is one of four Baltimore Orioles that have been recorded since the beginning of the year in Massachusetts.&nbsp; One was seen on Nantucket Island, another on Cape Cod. Oddly, the third one, a bright male, began coming to a feeder in Roslindale, only a few miles from my home,&nbsp; in December of 2012, and continued to return well into January.</p>





<p>&ldquo;My&rdquo; oriole continued to hold out as the wind and snow intensified and the competition for food increased:</p>

<p>Given the severity of the blizzard, and the vulnerability of all birds in such weather I wondered if I would see the oriole again. The next morning as the storm began to wind down I looked out and there she was:</p>

<p>Out of place and time birds like this one attract a lot of attention.&nbsp; People empathize with these stragglers and root for them against the weather.&nbsp; In the process they are often seen as strong, adventurous and courageous.&nbsp; Some have just fallen prey to heavy winds that blow them far off course. But many of these vagrants are immature birds and may be defective in some way.&nbsp; Perhaps their GPS system is not up to par.</p>





<p>Will this bird make it until the spring?&nbsp; If so she could re-unite with others of her species, breed, and have another chance to get it right in next fall&rsquo;s migration. The odds are not in her favor.&nbsp; Avian mortality is quite high, even for those that are on track.&nbsp; Fifty percent or more of some species perish one way or another, especially in the first year.</p>





<p>But each morning I check the feeders and am happy when I see her again:</p>

<p>Many years ago while I was in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps I learned that in rural villages babies were not named until after they had survived the passage of a smallpox epidemic.&nbsp; If I were of a mind to start naming my feeder birds she would be up for a christening by now.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect to see her in the Arboretum this summer, but she does look determined.</p>

<p>Keep watching those feeders- you never know what might show up!</p>
